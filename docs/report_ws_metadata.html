<h1><a href="http://www.informatiewetenschap.org/act_thema.html#metadata" target="_blank">Workshop Metadata or not?</a></h1>
Organized by <a href="http://www.informatiewetenschap.org" target="_blank">Vereniging Werkgemeenschap Informatiewetenschap</a><br/>
Visited by Katharina Schwarz<br/>
<b>19.05.2004, Auberge du Bonheur, Tilburg.</b>

<h3>First talk: M. van Mackelenbergh, zelfstandig adviseur - <a href="http://informatiewetenschap.org/docs/md_mackelenbergh_mei2004.ppt" target="_blank">Metadata, the art of adding signposts</a></h3>
One of Marcel's interests is to find a scientifically tested method for creating good metadata. According to his research and experience, he has identified the following four characteristics of metadata:
<ul>
<li>aboutness</li>
<li>only useful information</li>
<li>only relevant information for target group</li>
<li>clear and precise</li>
</ul>
He observed that generally there are not all that many target groups, usually just one or two, so it is possible to identify precisely the characteristics and requirements of these target groups.
<p/>
<i>Comment:</i>
<br/>
The description of good metadata reminds me of best practices for web design. It is recognized that these issues are important, but putting them in practice is the hard part. I disagree with his opinion to make only useful and relevant metadata, because it is not possible to foresee which metadata will be needed when by whom.

<h3>Second talk: Prof C. Koster, Universiteit Nijmegen - <a href="http://informatiewetenschap.org/docs/md_koster_mei2004.pdf" target="_blank">Contextual and contentual meta data</a></h3>
Koster gave a talk in which he defended both a pro and a con view on metadata. He first compared the metadata problems with thesaurus problems. Some of the typical problems he listed are changes in terminology, updating metadata, adding new types of metadata to old information objects and human errors.
<p/>
A solution he presented was to distinguish <em>contextual</em> from <em>contentual</em> metadata. The former can and should be made right away, because it cannot be done at a later point in time. The latter, in contrast, can be done automatically at any time, provided the full text of the content is stored as well, preferably in ASCII. He described the following techniques:
<ul>
<li>automatic document classification - look for similarity between new document and example documents</li>
<li>term extraction</li>
<li>full-text mining</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
After the break the group was split in two. One half prepared arguments supporting the statement that humans would always be needed when creating metadata, the other group defended the statement that all metadata creation will at one point be automated. I was in the former group, our arguments were that <ul>
<li>machines cannot extract meaningful metadata from information objects in other formats than texts, like images, audio files, executables etc,</li>
<li>documents carry an explicit and an implicit meaning, and only a human can find that implicit meaning (compare political message in Orwell's Animal Farm), and</li>
<li>human intervention is definitely needed when merging different metadata sets, because only humans can see the overlapping meanings.</li>
</ul>
We had a proper discussion between the two groups, with feelings running high and many dirty rhetorical attempts to shatter the opponent's composure and reasoning! All in good spirit, of course. The opponents' favourite argument was that all the things we brought forward as proof that automation is impossible, was that it is not possible YET, but will be in the future...
<p/>
It was a successful and fun workshop, at which I met some members of the WGI for the first time and learned about their backgrounds and interests in Informatiewetenschap. There were also members of the DARE community, and I got a feeling for the many angles from which people are interested in the field of information storage, usage and sharing.
